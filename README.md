# about me
My Name is Alex,I'm A positive person, full of optimism. I love mathematics, algorithms, logic problems.
I try to optimize the processes in my area of responsibility and usually follow the Pareto principle: 80% of a project's results are due to 20% of the work.
I have no experience in development, but I studied programming on Java, Ruby, and started learning python by myself. 
I worked in the support service as a project manager for 4 years. I am familliar with various ticket system like jira, naumen, remedy, etc..
There was no possibility to get a IT job without experience, and I have to work as sales manager, but I really want to change my field of activity.
